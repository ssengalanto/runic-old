// Package interfaces provides the interface definitions used by the application.
//
// The interfaces package defines various interfaces that represent common behaviors and abstractions
// used throughout the application. These interfaces serve as contracts that define the expected
// methods and functionality for different components and can be implemented by concrete types.
//
// By using interfaces, the application achieves loose coupling, allowing different components to
// interact and collaborate without having direct dependencies on each other. This promotes modular
// design, code reusability, and easier testing and mocking of components.
//
// The interfaces defined in this package cover different aspects such as logging, configuration,
// database access, external service integration, and more. These interfaces provide a flexible and
// extensible foundation for the application's architecture, allowing different implementations
// to be easily swapped and customized based on specific requirements.
